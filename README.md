# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
This folder details the notebooks and datasets used in completing the DataCamp guided and unguided projects, Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office. 

## Overall Description
The skills developed in DataCamp's 'Intermediate Python' course are used to manipulate and visualise data from Netflix and The Office.

Project information
## A - Guided Project üìù
Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib. 

### Tasks:
1. Loading your friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?


## B - Unguided Project üìùüåü
Bring together a wide variety of skills from Intermediate Python to prepare and plot data on the history of the sitcom The Office.

### Question 1:
Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:
‚Ä£ Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis  
‚Ä£ Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis  
‚Ä£ A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:  
-‚Ä£ Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"  
-‚Ä£ Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"  
-‚Ä£ Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"  
-‚Ä£ Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"  
‚Ä£ A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25  
‚Ä£ A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"  
‚Ä£ An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"  
‚Ä£ A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"

### Question 2:
Provide the name of one of the guest stars (hint, there were multiple!) who was in the most watched Office episode. Save it as a string in the variable top_star (e.g. top_star = "Will Ferrell").

Important!
To test your matplotlib plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot fig object, which you can do using the code fig = plt.figure() (provided you have imported matplotlib.pyplot as plt). In addition, in order to test it correctly, please make sure to specify your plot (including the type, data, labels, etc) in the same cell as the one you initialize your figure (fig)! You are still free to use other cells to load data, experiment, and answer Question 2.

In addition, if you want to be able to see a larger version of your plot, you can set the figure size parameters using this code (provided again you have imported matplotlib.pyplot as plt):

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [11, 7]

### Bonus Step!
Although it was not taught in Intermediate Python, a useful skill for visualizing different data points is to use a different marker. You can learn more about them via the Matplotlib documentation or via our course Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib. Thus, as a bonus step, try to differentiate guest appearances not just with size, but also with a star!

All other attributes still apply (data on the axes, color scheme, sizes for guest appearances, title, and axis labels).
